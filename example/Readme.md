# Example

## XOR problem
+ The XOR problem is a simple problem that is used to demonstrate the power of neural networks. The problem is to predict the output of the XOR gate given two inputs. The output is 1 if the inputs are different and 0 if the inputs are the same.

Command: ```make xor```

## Handwritten digits recognition
+ The handwritten digits recognition example uses the MNIST dataset to train a neural network to recognize handwritten digits. The dataset is included in the `data` directory. The dataset is split into a training set and a test set. The training set is used to train the network and the test set is used to evaluate the performance of the network.

Unzip this dataset first: [mnist.zip](example/src/mnist/data/Archive.zip) and then use Command: ```make mnist```
